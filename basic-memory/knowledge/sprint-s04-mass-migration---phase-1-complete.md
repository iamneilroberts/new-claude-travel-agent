title: Sprint S04 Mass Migration - Phase 1 Complete
type: project
---

Successfully completed Phase 1 of Sprint S04 mass migration to pure MCP protocol. Migrated 3 additional servers (amadeus-api-mcp, r2-storage-mcp, template-document-mcp) to pure MCP implementation using proven D1 pattern. All 4 servers now use mcp-remote with direct JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol. Updated Claude Desktop configuration to use pure MCP endpoints. All servers deployed, tested, and working correctly. Total progress: 4 of 8 servers (50%) now using pure MCP. Remaining 4 servers (google-places-api, mobile-interaction, prompt-instructions, sequential-thinking) still need Zod refactoring + pure MCP migration.
