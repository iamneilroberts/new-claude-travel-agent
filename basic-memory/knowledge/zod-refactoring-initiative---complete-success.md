title: Zod Refactoring Initiative - Complete Success
type: project
---

Successfully completed the migration of 4 MCP servers from Zod to direct JSON schemas, resolving critical schema validation issues and achieving significant performance improvements. All 4 servers (amadeus-api-mcp, d1-database_2, r2-storage-mcp, template-document-mcp) are now deployed and working with complete schemas. Root cause was wrangler.toml files pointing to stale compiled JavaScript instead of updated TypeScript source files. Bundle sizes reduced significantly (d1-database: 162KB to 37KB). All deployment URLs are working and returning proper JSON schemas.
