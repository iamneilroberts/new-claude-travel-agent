# MCP Server Startup Issues: Root Causes and Solutions

## Issue Summary
During the deployment of pure MCP implementations to Cloudflare Workers, multiple MCP servers in Claude Desktop showed 'Could not attach to MCP server' errors with DNS resolution failures (EAI_AGAIN) and connection timeouts.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. DNS Resolution Issues
- **Symptom**:  errors in logs
- **Cause**: Intermittent DNS resolution failures for *.somotravel.workers.dev domains
- **Frequency**: Appeared during initial connection attempts

### 2. Connection Timeouts  
- **Symptom**:  with 10000ms timeout
- **Cause**: Network connectivity delays during Claude Desktop startup
- **Impact**: Failed initial handshake with remote workers

### 3. Missing MCP Protocol Methods
- **Symptom**: Servers showing as 'Disabled' in Claude Desktop
- **Cause**: Missing  and  method implementations
- **Resolution**: Added required methods returning empty arrays

## Diagnostic Results

### Worker Health Check ✅
All Cloudflare Workers are healthy and responding:
- r2-storage-mcp-pure.somotravel.workers.dev: HTTP 200, SSE headers correct
- basic-memory-mcp-pure.somotravel.workers.dev: HTTP 200, SSE headers correct  
- pure-amadeus-api-mcp.somotravel.workers.dev: HTTP 200, SSE headers correct
- mobile-interaction-mcp-pure.somotravel.workers.dev: HTTP 200, SSE headers correct

### MCP Protocol Test ✅
Direct MCP protocol communication successful:
- JSON-RPC 2.0 initialization working correctly
- Authentication with bearer tokens functioning
- Server info and capabilities properly returned

### mcp-remote Client Test ✅
Command-line mcp-remote connections stable and working

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Protocol Compliance
Added missing MCP methods to all workers:


### 2. Claude Desktop Process Reset
Resolved stale connection states by:
- Killing all Claude Desktop processes
- Clearing connection cache
- Fresh startup allowing new DNS resolution

### 3. Configuration Verification
Confirmed Claude Desktop configuration using mcp-remote correctly:


## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Health Monitoring
- Regular curl tests of worker SSE endpoints
- MCP protocol initialization tests
- DNS resolution monitoring

### 2. Graceful Fallbacks
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- DNS cache refresh mechanisms
- Alternative connection transport methods

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages in worker responses
- Connection state diagnostics
- Timeout configuration optimization

## Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED
All MCP servers now connecting successfully after:
1. Process restart
2. Protocol method additions  
3. DNS resolution refresh

The migration from Zod schemas to pure MCP implementations is complete and functional.
