# Sprint S05 MCP Network Connectivity Analysis and Fix

## Problem Analysis
The issue was not with the MCP protocol compliance (which was already fixed) but with **network connectivity problems** affecting mcp-remote connections to Cloudflare Workers.

## Root Cause: Network Connectivity Issues
1. **DNS Resolution Failures**:  errors indicating temporary DNS lookup failures
2. **Connection Timeouts**: 10-second default timeouts were insufficient for unstable connections
3. **Network Instability**: Multiple servers experiencing intermittent connectivity issues

## Verification Steps Performed
1. **Worker Health Checks**: All Cloudflare Workers are healthy and accessible via direct curl
2. **DNS Testing**: Domain resolution works correctly
3. **Network Testing**: Basic connectivity (ping) functions normally
4. **Log Analysis**: Identified pattern of timeout and DNS errors in MCP logs

## Solution Applied
Added  (30-second timeout) to all mcp-remote connections in Claude Desktop configuration to make connections more resilient to network instability.

## Technical Details
- **All Cloudflare Workers are functional**: Every server responds with healthy status
- **MCP Protocol Fixes Already Applied**: resources/list and prompts/list methods were successfully implemented
- **Connection Resilience Improved**: Extended timeouts should reduce connection failures

## Files Modified
-  - Added timeout configurations to all 10 MCP servers

## Status
Network connectivity issues addressed through configuration improvements. Claude Desktop restart required to test new configuration.

## Next Steps
User should restart Claude Desktop to verify that all MCP servers now connect successfully with improved timeout configuration.
