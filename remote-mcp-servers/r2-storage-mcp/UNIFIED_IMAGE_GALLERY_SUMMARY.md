# Unified Image Gallery MCP: Project Summary

This document provides an executive summary of the Unified Image Gallery MCP project, its components, and implementation strategy.

## Project Overview

The Unified Image Gallery MCP is a specialized service that enables Claude Desktop to present image options to users and capture their selections for travel planning documents. It bridges the gap between various image sources (Google Places, etc.), user selection, and the travel planning database.

## Key Components

1. **MCP Protocol Implementation**: JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant interface for Claude
2. **Gallery Web Interface**: Responsive UI for image selection
3. **R2 Storage Management**: Organized image storage system
4. **Image Providers**: Adapters for various image sources
5. **Database Integration**: Storage and retrieval of selection metadata

## Core Functionality

1. **Gallery Creation**: Claude initiates gallery creation with a search query
2. **Image Fetching**: System fetches images from Google Places and other sources
3. **User Selection**: User selects primary and additional images
4. **Storage**: Selected images are stored in R2 with proper organization
5. **Database Update**: Claude updates the travel database with selection info
6. **Document Integration**: Images are incorporated into travel documents

## Deliverables

The project includes the following deliverables:

1. **Requirements Document**: [UNIFIED_IMAGE_GALLERY_REQUIREMENTS.md](./UNIFIED_IMAGE_GALLERY_REQUIREMENTS.md)
2. **Architecture Design**: [UNIFIED_IMAGE_GALLERY_ARCHITECTURE.md](./UNIFIED_IMAGE_GALLERY_ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. **R2 Storage Strategy**: [R2_STORAGE_STRATEGY.md](./R2_STORAGE_STRATEGY.md)
4. **UI Design**: [GALLERY_UI_DESIGN.md](./GALLERY_UI_DESIGN.md)
5. **Implementation Plan**: [MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
6. **Claude Integration Guide**: [CLAUDE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](./CLAUDE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)
7. **Cloudflare Worker Code**: To be implemented according to plan

## Implementation Timeline

The implementation is planned over a 6-week period:
- **Weeks 1-2**: Core infrastructure and image provider integration
- **Weeks 3-4**: Frontend and MCP tools implementation
- **Weeks 5-6**: Testing, optimization, and deployment

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Cloudflare Worker**: Chosen for seamless integration with R2 and D1
2. **Stateful Galleries**: Galleries maintain state in D1 database
3. **Token-based Security**: Secure gallery access via tokens
4. **Organized R2 Storage**: Hierarchical storage for efficient retrieval
5. **Responsive UI**: Works on all devices for seamless user experience

## Integration Points

1. **Claude Desktop**: Via MCP protocol
2. **Travel Database**: Through D1 queries
3. **Google Places**: For image sourcing
4. **R2 Storage**: For permanent image storage
5. **User Browser**: For image selection interface

## Next Steps

1. **Development Kickoff**: Initialize project structure and repositories
2. **Initial Implementation**: Core functionality and MCP protocol
3. **Review Cycles**: Regular reviews for alignment with requirements
4. **User Testing**: Validate UI and workflow
5. **Deployment**: Staged rollout to production

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Image Sources**: Expand beyond Google Places
2. **Advanced Image Processing**: Optimize images for different uses
3. **AI-powered Selection**: Smart suggestions for image selection
4. **Analytics Integration**: Track usage patterns and preferences
5. **Multi-user Collaboration**: Allow multiple stakeholders to participate in selection
