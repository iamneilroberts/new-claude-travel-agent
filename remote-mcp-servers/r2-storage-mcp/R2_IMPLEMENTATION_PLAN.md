# R2 Storage MCP Implementation Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ MCP Worker deployed to Cloudflare at r2-storage-mcp.somotravel.workers.dev
- ✅ MCP interface implemented with working JSON-RPC endpoints
- ✅ Basic authentication configured with X-API-Token header
- ✅ Claude Desktop configuration updated to include the new MCP service
- ⏳ R2 storage integration pending

## Steps to Enable R2 Storage

### 1. Enable R2 in Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Log in to the Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Go to R2 Storage in the navigation menu
3. Click "Create bucket"
4. Name the bucket "travel-media"
5. Configure any additional settings (visibility, access control, etc.)

### 2. Update Wrangler Configuration
1. Update the wrangler.toml file to include the R2 bucket binding:
   ```toml
   [[r2_buckets]]
   binding = "TRAVEL_MEDIA_BUCKET"
   bucket_name = "travel-media"
   ```

### 3. Deploy Updated MCP Worker
1. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the updated worker with R2 bindings

### 4. Verify R2 Integration
1. Test basic bucket operations (list, get, create, delete)
2. Test object operations (put, get, list, delete)
3. Test presigned URL generation
4. Verify Claude can access and use the R2 storage tools properly

### 5. Production Setup Documentation
1. Document API token setup for production
2. Document R2 bucket configuration best practices
3. Add image handling workflows to the system documentation
4. Update Claude's instructions to include R2 storage capabilities

## Best Practices for R2 Integration
- Use presigned URLs for temporary access to avoid sharing permanent credentials
- Organize objects with consistent prefixes (e.g., "hotels/", "activities/")
- Add metadata to objects for better searchability
- Implement lifecycle rules for older objects if needed
- Monitor usage and costs
- Implement proper error handling for storage operations

## Next Steps
- Create helper utilities to simplify common operations
- Implement thumbnail generation for image assets
- Add support for additional media types
- Connect with the image gallery MCP for a complete media workflow
