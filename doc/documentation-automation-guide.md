# Documentation Automation and Context Management with Claude Code

## CLAUDE.md Living Documentation Strategy

### Feature Tracking Workflow:
- **Feature Status Sections**: Maintain current development status in dedicated sections
- **Decision Log Integration**: Document architectural decisions with rationale and alternatives considered
- **Progress Checkpoints**: Update CLAUDE.md after major milestones or phase completions
- **Context Preservation**: Keep history of working solutions and failed approaches

### Active Development Tracking Template:
```markdown
## Current Development Status - [DATE]

### Active Features:
- **[Feature Name]**: Status (planning/development/testing/complete)
  - Progress: [X/Y tasks complete]
  - Next Steps: [specific actionable items]
  - Blockers: [any impediments]
  - Decision Points: [choices needed]

### Recent Decisions:
- **[Decision Topic]**: [Choice made] - [Date] - [Rationale]
- **[Architecture Choice]**: [Selected approach] - [Why chosen over alternatives]

### Working Solutions:
- **[Problem/Tool]**: [Solution that works] - [Context/Notes]
- **[Integration Pattern]**: [Successful approach] - [Usage example]

### Failed Approaches (Learn from these):
- **[Attempted Solution]**: [Why it failed] - [What to avoid]
```

## Automated Documentation Commands:
- **Context Updates**: After feature completion, auto-update CLAUDE.md sections
- **Decision Capture**: Prompt to document choices during development sessions
- **Progress Sync**: Regular CLAUDE.md updates aligned with commit checkpoints
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Convert session learnings into reusable documentation

## Pre-Commit Documentation Hooks:
- **Auto-validate CLAUDE.md syntax**: Ensure markdown formatting is correct
- **Documentation currency check**: Verify status sections reflect current state
- **Decision log completeness**: Confirm major changes have decision entries
- **Context accuracy validation**: Check that documented solutions still work

### .pre-commit-config.yaml Integration:
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: claude-md-validation
        name: Validate CLAUDE.md structure
        entry: scripts/validate-claude-md.sh
        language: system
        files: CLAUDE\.md$
      
      - id: documentation-sync
        name: Sync documentation with codebase changes
        entry: scripts/sync-docs.sh
        language: system
        always_run: true
```

## Context Management Automation:

### Session Memory Patterns:
- **Session Initialization**: Auto-load relevant CLAUDE.md sections based on file changes
- **Cross-session Continuity**: Maintain context between different Claude Code sessions
- **Knowledge Consolidation**: Merge learnings from multiple sessions into permanent documentation
- **Team Synchronization**: Ensure CLAUDE.md updates are shared across team members

### Intelligent Context Filtering:
- **Relevance Scoring**: Prioritize CLAUDE.md sections based on current task context
- **Dynamic Loading**: Include only pertinent documentation sections for specific operations
- **Context Cleanup**: Archive outdated information while preserving historical decisions
- **Smart Linking**: Cross-reference related documentation sections automatically

## Progress Tracking Integration:

### Feature Development Lifecycle:
- **Inception**: Document requirements and acceptance criteria in CLAUDE.md
- **Design**: Record architectural decisions and rationale
- **Implementation**: Track progress with checkboxes and status updates
- **Testing**: Document test strategies and validation results
- **Deployment**: Record deployment procedures and rollback plans
- **Retrospective**: Capture lessons learned and process improvements

### Automated Progress Indicators:
- **Commit-based Updates**: Auto-update progress based on git commits
- **Test Result Integration**: Sync test status with documentation
- **Deployment Status**: Reflect current deployment state in CLAUDE.md
- **Issue Tracking**: Link GitHub issues to documentation sections

## Practical Documentation Automation Usage

### Use the Active Development Template
When starting a new feature, add this to CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
## Current Development Status - 2025-05-27

### Active Features:
- **User Authentication**: development
  - Progress: 2/5 tasks complete
  - Next Steps: implement password hashing, add session management
  - Blockers: need to choose JWT vs session storage
  - Decision Points: security vs simplicity trade-off
```

### Document Decisions as You Make Them
When Claude Code suggests an approach, ask:
- "Add this decision to CLAUDE.md: chose JWT over sessions because of stateless scalability"
- "Document why we rejected Redux in favor of Context API"

### Capture Working Solutions
After solving a problem:
- "Add this working MCP deployment pattern to CLAUDE.md"
- "Document this successful API integration approach"

## Workflow Optimization Tricks

### Use Context Commands
Create `.claude/commands/` files for repeated workflows:

**File: `.claude/commands/deploy-mcp.md`**
```markdown
Deploy MCP server with these steps:
1. Run tests: npm test
2. Build: npm run build  
3. Deploy: wrangler deploy
4. Verify: test connection
5. Update CLAUDE.md with deployment status
```

Then use: `/deploy-mcp` in any session

### Smart Context Loading
- Say "focus on authentication module" - Claude Code will prioritize relevant files/docs
- Use "think about the MCP server architecture" for extended analysis
- Ask "what's our current progress on hotel booking?" for status updates

### Batch Operations
**Instead of individual requests:**
```
1. Fix linting errors
2. Update tests  
3. Deploy to staging
```

**Use batch approach:**
"Fix linting, update tests, and deploy to staging using our standard workflow"

## Daily Workflow Tips

### Session Startup Routine
1. **Check status**: "What's our current development status?"
2. **Review context**: Claude Code auto-loads relevant CLAUDE.md sections
3. **Set focus**: "Today we're working on hotel search feature"

### End-of-Session Routine  
1. **Update progress**: "Update CLAUDE.md with today's progress"
2. **Document decisions**: "Add any architectural choices to decision log"
3. **Commit checkpoint**: "Commit current progress with descriptive message"

### Cross-Session Continuity
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/session-20250527-hotel-search`
- Let Claude Code maintain CLAUDE.md updates automatically
- Check "Recent Decisions" section when resuming work

## Team Knowledge Sharing

### Documentation Patterns
- **Problem-Solution Documentation**: Document both the problem and working solution
- **Failed Approach Learning**: Record what didn't work and why to avoid repeating mistakes
- **Context Transfer**: Convert session learnings into reusable team knowledge

The key is treating CLAUDE.md as a living memory system that grows with your project, while using Claude Code's automation to reduce manual documentation overhead.
