# Claude Travel Agent System Description

## Overview

The Claude Travel Agent System is a comprehensive AI-powered travel planning and management platform that combines multiple specialized MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to provide end-to-end travel services. The system assists travel agent Kim Henderson of Somo Travel in creating detailed travel proposals, managing client information, searching for travel options, and generating professional travel documents.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

The system consists of 7 specialized MCP servers that work together through a unified bridge client:

1. **Amadeus API MCP** - Travel booking and search APIs
