## Coordination Infrastructure

### Shared Memory System
The team uses a structured shared memory system for coordination:

```
memory/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ coordination/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ daily_sync.md          # Agent status updates
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ handoffs.md            # Work item transfers
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blockers.md            # Current blockers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ decisions/                 # Architectural decisions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ progress/                  # Project milestones
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ architect/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ context.md             # Agent-specific context
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ findings.md            # Analysis results
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ builder/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ context.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ implementation_log.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ validator/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ context.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_results.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ documenter/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ context.md
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ documentation_status.md
â””â”€â”€ state/
    â””â”€â”€ current-phase.json         # Project state tracking
```

### Communication Protocols

#### Daily Sync Updates
Each agent maintains status in `memory/shared/coordination/daily_sync.md`:
- Current status (Ready/In Progress/Waiting/Blocked)
- Active work items and progress
- Dependencies and blockers
- Expected completion timelines
- Next steps

#### Handoff Management
Work transfers between agents use structured handoffs in `agents/handoffs/`:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Context and background information
- Required files and resources
- Success metrics
- Timeline expectations

#### Decision Documentation
All architectural and process decisions are documented with:
- Decision rationale
- Alternatives considered
- Impact assessment
- Implementation requirements

## Workflow Patterns

### Standard Development Cycle

1. **Architecture Phase**
   - Architect analyzes requirements
   - Designs system components
   - Documents implementation approach
   - Creates handoff to Builder

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Builder receives architectural guidance
   - Implements features following specifications
   - Documents code and progress
   - Creates handoff to Validator

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Validator tests implementation
   - Reports bugs and issues
   - Validates against requirements
   - Creates handoff to Documenter

4. **Documentation Phase**
   - Documenter updates all documentation
   - Creates user guides and API docs
   - Maintains knowledge base
   - Completes project cycle

### Emergency Response Pattern

For critical issues requiring immediate attention:

1. **Problem Detection**: Any agent can identify critical issues
2. **Escalation**: Immediate notification in `blockers.md`
3. **Architect Analysis**: Quick technical assessment
4. **Rapid Implementation**: Builder prioritizes fix
5. **Emergency Testing**: Validator provides fast validation
6. **Documentation**: Documenter captures lessons learned

### Parallel Work Pattern

For independent work streams:

1. **Work Decomposition**: Architect breaks down complex features
2. **Parallel Assignment**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
3. **Coordination Checkpoints**: Regular sync in `daily_sync.md`
4. **Integration Planning**: Careful merge and testing strategy
5. **Unified Documentation**: Documenter maintains coherent docs

## Current Project: MCP Implementation Fixes

### Project Context
**Objective**: Fix "Method not found" errors across 8 MCP servers
**Timeline**: 6-7 hours across two phases
**Success Criteria**: Zero MCP protocol errors, maintained functionality

### Phase Implementation

**Phase 1**: Framework Fixes âœ… COMPLETED
- Architect analyzed problem and designed solution
- Builder implemented McpAgent framework pattern
- Validator deployed and tested fixes
- Documenter captured process

**Phase 2**: Method Handler Implementation ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- Architect provided detailed implementation instructions
- Builder currently implementing across 5 servers
- Validator standing by for deployment testing
- Documenter updating real-time documentation

### Coordination Success Factors

1. **Clear Handoffs**: Detailed instructions eliminate ambiguity
2. **Shared Context**: All agents access same information
3. **Real-time Updates**: Daily sync keeps everyone informed
4. **Specialized Roles**: Each agent focuses on strengths
5. **Documentation First**: Process captured for future use

## Best Practices

### Effective Communication
- **Be Specific**: Provide exact file paths and line numbers
- **Include Context**: Explain why decisions were made
- **Document Assumptions**: Make implicit knowledge explicit
- **Use Templates**: Standardized formats improve clarity

### Quality Assurance
- **Incremental Progress**: Small, validated steps reduce risk
- **Continuous Testing**: Validate at each phase
- **Rollback Planning**: Maintain known good states
- **Documentation Sync**: Keep docs current with code

### Risk Management
- **Dependency Tracking**: Identify and manage blocking relationships
- **Timeline Buffers**: Account for unexpected complexity
- **Alternative Plans**: Prepare fallback approaches
- **Regular Checkpoints**: Frequent validation prevents drift

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Communication Breakdowns
**Symptoms**: Missing context, unclear requirements
**Solution**: Use structured handoff templates, require explicit acceptance

### Work Duplication
**Symptoms**: Multiple agents working on same items
**Solution**: Clear ownership in `daily_sync.md`, handoff protocols

### Integration Problems
**Symptoms**: Components don't work together
**Solution**: Architect oversight, integration testing by Validator

### Documentation Lag
**Symptoms**: Code and docs out of sync
**Solution**: Real-time updates by Documenter, doc reviews in handoffs

## Metrics & Success Indicators

### Process Metrics
- **Handoff Success Rate**: Percentage of clean transfers
- **Cycle Time**: Time from requirement to completion
- **Bug Detection Rate**: Issues found in validation vs production
- **Documentation Coverage**: Percentage of features documented

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Review Coverage**: Percentage of changes reviewed
- **Test Coverage**: Automated test coverage percentage
- **Error Rates**: System errors and failures
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on documentation quality

### Coordination Metrics
- **Response Time**: Time to acknowledge handoffs
- **Blocker Resolution**: Average time to resolve dependencies
- **Communication Frequency**: Updates per day/week
- **Decision Speed**: Time from problem to solution

## Future Enhancements

### Automation Opportunities
- Automated handoff notifications
- Integration testing pipelines
- Documentation generation
- Metric collection and reporting

### Process Improvements
- Advanced coordination templates
- Risk assessment frameworks
- Knowledge management systems
- Cross-agent skill development

### Tool Integration
- Real-time collaboration platforms
- Automated testing frameworks
- Documentation automation
- Project management integration
