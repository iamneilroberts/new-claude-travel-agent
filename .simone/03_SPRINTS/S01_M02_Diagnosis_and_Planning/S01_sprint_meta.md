# Sprint S01: Basic-Memory MCP Diagnosis and Planning

## Sprint Goals
Diagnose current basic-memory MCP connectivity issues and create a comprehensive plan to enable full CRUD operations via MCP tools in Claude Code.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Root cause of MCP connectivity issues identified
- [ ] Current Claude Code MCP configuration analyzed
- [ ] Technical implementation plan for CRUD operations created
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation strategy documented

## Tasks Overview
- T01_S01: Diagnose MCP Connectivity Issues
- T02_S01: Analyze Claude Code MCP Integration  
- T03_S01: Document CRUD Operation Requirements
- T04_S01: Create Technical Implementation Plan

## Current Issues to Address
1. **MCP Tools Not Available**: basic-memory MCP tools not accessible in Claude Code
2. **CLI-Only Restriction**: Note writing currently restricted to command line
3. **Limited Functionality**: Only read/search operations available via MCP
4. **Integration Problems**: Poor Claude Code integration experience

## Dependencies
- Access to basic-memory codebase
- Claude Code MCP configuration files
- Successful D1 MCP migration patterns (reference)

## Sprint Deliverables
- Complete diagnosis report
- Technical implementation roadmap  
- Risk mitigation strategy
- Sprint S02 task breakdown
