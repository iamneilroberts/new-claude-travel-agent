# Task: System Integration and Production Deployment

## Description
Complete the integration of all testing system components and deploy to production environment. This includes configuring Claude Desktop integration, setting up monitoring, and ensuring the system works seamlessly with existing MCP server infrastructure.

## Goal / Objectives
Deploy a fully integrated, production-ready automated testing system that operates reliably in the existing infrastructure.
- Integrate all testing components into cohesive system
- Deploy to production Cloudflare Workers environment
- Configure Claude Desktop for testing server access
- Establish monitoring and alerting
- Validate end-to-end functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All testing components integrated and communicating properly
- [ ] Testing MCP server deployed to production Cloudflare Workers
- [ ] Claude Desktop configured with testing server in claude_desktop_config.json
- [ ] Web dashboard deployed and accessible
- [ ] Database systems (D1) configured for production data storage
- [ ] Monitoring and logging established for all components
- [ ] End-to-end testing validates complete workflow
- [ ] Documentation updated with deployment and usage instructions
