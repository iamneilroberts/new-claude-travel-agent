# Task: Automated Test Scenario Generator

## Description
Develop an intelligent system that automatically generates realistic travel planning scenarios for testing. The generator should create diverse, challenging scenarios that comprehensively test all aspects of the travel agent system including flights, hotels, activities, and multi-step workflows.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a robust scenario generation engine that produces varied, realistic travel planning challenges to thoroughly test the Claude Desktop travel agent system.
- Generate scenarios across different complexity levels (simple, intermediate, complex)
- Include diverse travel types (business, leisure, family, solo, group)
- Cover various geographic regions and travel patterns
- Incorporate edge cases and challenging requirements
- Ensure reproducible and deterministic test generation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Generates at least 20 distinct scenario types with parameters
- [ ] Covers simple (single tool), intermediate (multi-parameter), and complex (multi-step) scenarios
- [ ] Includes realistic travel dates, destinations, passenger counts, and preferences
- [ ] Generates edge cases: last-minute bookings, complex itineraries, budget constraints
- [ ] Produces consistent, reproducible scenarios from seed values
- [ ] Includes expected outcomes and success criteria for each scenario
- [ ] Scenarios are stored in structured format for analysis and iteration
- [ ] Generator can create variations of existing scenarios for retesting

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design scenario data structure and schema
- [ ] Implement simple scenario templates (single MCP tool usage)
- [ ] Create intermediate scenario templates (multi-parameter searches)
- [ ] Develop complex scenario templates (multi-step workflows)
- [ ] Add realistic travel data: destinations, dates, traveler profiles
- [ ] Implement edge case scenario generation
- [ ] Create scenario variation and mutation system
- [ ] Build expected outcome prediction logic
- [ ] Add scenario persistence and retrieval system
- [ ] Test scenario quality and diversity
- [ ] Document scenario format and generation rules
