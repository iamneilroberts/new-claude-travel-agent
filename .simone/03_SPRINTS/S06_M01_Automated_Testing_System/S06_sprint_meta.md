# Sprint: Automated Testing System for Claude Desktop Travel Agent (S06)

## Sprint Goal
Create a comprehensive automated testing framework that generates realistic travel scenarios, executes them through Claude Desktop, captures conversation transcripts, and provides detailed analysis and scoring of travel agent performance.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- **Testing MCP Server**: Core server that provides testing tools to Claude Desktop
- **Test Scenario Generator**: Automated creation of realistic travel planning scenarios
- **Conversation Capture System**: Full transcript recording and MCP tool call monitoring
- **Analysis Engine**: Automated scoring of accuracy, completeness, helpfulness, and efficiency
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time test progress, results visualization, and reporting
- **Test Iteration System**: Automatic re-testing and improvement tracking
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing MCP server ecosystem

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- [ ] Testing MCP server deployed and functional in Claude Desktop
- [ ] Automated test scenario generation producing 20+ realistic travel cases
- [ ] Full conversation capture including MCP tool calls and responses
- [ ] Scoring system evaluating 5+ quality metrics with detailed analysis
- [ ] Web dashboard displaying real-time test results and historical data
- [ ] Test iteration system automatically improving failing tests
- [ ] End-to-end testing validates system accuracy and usefulness
- [ ] Documentation and deployment guides completed

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Leverage existing MCP server infrastructure and patterns
- Focus on MCP-native approach for seamless Claude Desktop integration
- Ensure scalability for running multiple test scenarios simultaneously
- Consider integration with existing mcp-watcher-service for monitoring
- Plan for extensibility to add new test types and scoring criteria
