# Task: Automated Test Iteration and Improvement System

## Description
Implement an intelligent system that automatically identifies failing or low-scoring tests and iterates on them to improve performance. The system should analyze failure patterns, generate test variations, and track improvement over time until tests reach target performance levels.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a self-improving testing system that automatically optimizes test scenarios and tracks performance improvements.
- Automatically identify tests that fall below performance thresholds
- Generate improved test variations based on failure analysis
- Track test performance improvement over iterations
- Implement stopping criteria for successful optimization
- Provide insights into systemic issues and patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatically detects tests scoring below configurable thresholds
- [ ] Analyzes failure patterns to identify improvement opportunities
- [ ] Generates test variations with modified parameters or approaches
- [ ] Tracks test performance across multiple iterations
- [ ] Implements stopping criteria (target score reached or max iterations)
- [ ] Provides iteration history and improvement tracking
- [ ] Identifies systemic issues affecting multiple tests
- [ ] Generates reports on test optimization effectiveness
- [ ] Handles iteration limits and prevents infinite loops

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design test performance tracking and threshold system
- [ ] Implement failure pattern analysis algorithms
- [ ] Create test variation generation strategies
- [ ] Build iteration tracking and history management
- [ ] Implement stopping criteria and convergence detection
- [ ] Add systemic issue identification and reporting
- [ ] Create improvement trend analysis and visualization
- [ ] Build automated re-testing workflow
- [ ] Implement iteration limits and safety controls
- [ ] Add detailed iteration logging and debugging
- [ ] Test iteration effectiveness with sample scenarios
- [ ] Document iteration strategies and configuration options
