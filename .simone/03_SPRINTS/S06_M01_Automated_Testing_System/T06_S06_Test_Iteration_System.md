# Task: Automated Test Iteration and Improvement System

## Description
Implement an intelligent system that automatically identifies failing or low-scoring tests and iterates on them to improve performance. The system should analyze failure patterns, generate test variations, and track improvement over time until tests reach target performance levels.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a self-improving testing system that automatically optimizes test scenarios and tracks performance improvements.
- Automatically identify tests that fall below performance thresholds
- Generate improved test variations based on failure analysis
- Track test performance improvement over iterations
- Implement stopping criteria for successful optimization
- Provide insights into systemic issues and patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Automatically detects tests scoring below configurable thresholds
- [x] Analyzes failure patterns to identify improvement opportunities
- [x] Generates test variations with modified parameters or approaches
- [x] Tracks test performance across multiple iterations
- [x] Implements stopping criteria (target score reached or max iterations)
- [x] Provides iteration history and improvement tracking
- [x] Identifies systemic issues affecting multiple tests
- [x] Generates reports on test optimization effectiveness
- [x] Handles iteration limits and prevents infinite loops

## Subtasks
- [x] Design test performance tracking and threshold system
- [x] Implement failure pattern analysis algorithms
- [x] Create test variation generation strategies
- [x] Build iteration tracking and history management
- [x] Implement stopping criteria and convergence detection
- [x] Add systemic issue identification and reporting
- [x] Create improvement trend analysis and visualization
- [x] Build automated re-testing workflow
- [x] Implement iteration limits and safety controls
- [x] Add detailed iteration logging and debugging
- [x] Test iteration effectiveness with sample scenarios
- [x] Document iteration strategies and configuration options
