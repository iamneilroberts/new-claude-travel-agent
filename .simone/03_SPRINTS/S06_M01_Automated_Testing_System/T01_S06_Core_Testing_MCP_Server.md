# Task: Core Testing MCP Server Implementation

## Description
Create the foundational MCP server that provides testing capabilities to Claude Desktop. This server will be the central component that manages test scenarios, captures conversations, and coordinates the testing workflow. It follows the established mcp-remote pattern used throughout the project.

## Goal / Objectives
Build a production-ready MCP server that integrates seamlessly with Claude Desktop to provide comprehensive testing tools for travel agent scenarios.
- Implement core MCP server structure following project patterns
- Create essential testing tools for scenario execution and analysis
- Establish secure communication with Claude Desktop via mcp-remote protocol
- Deploy to Cloudflare Workers infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MCP server follows standardized project structure (src/, tools/, wrangler config)
- [ ] Implements core testing tools: execute_test_scenario, analyze_conversation, score_response
- [ ] Deploys successfully to Cloudflare Workers
- [ ] Integrates with Claude Desktop via claude_desktop_config.json
- [ ] Passes basic connectivity and tool execution tests
- [ ] Returns properly formatted MCP responses with error handling
- [ ] Includes comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create project structure following mcp-server-template
- [ ] Implement MCP server base with protocol handling
- [ ] Design and implement core testing tools
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for test scenarios and results
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging
- [ ] Create Wrangler configuration for Cloudflare deployment
- [ ] Write basic connectivity tests
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment and validate
- [ ] Update claude_desktop_config.json with new server
- [ ] Document server API and tool specifications
