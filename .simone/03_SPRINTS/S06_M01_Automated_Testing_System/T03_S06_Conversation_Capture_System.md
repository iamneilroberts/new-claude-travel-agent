# Task: Conversation Capture and Monitoring System

## Description
Implement a comprehensive system to capture and monitor Claude Desktop conversations during testing. This system must record full conversation transcripts, MCP tool calls, responses, timing data, and errors to enable detailed analysis of travel agent performance.

## Goal / Objectives
Build a robust conversation capture system that provides complete visibility into Claude Desktop testing sessions for accurate performance analysis.
- Capture full conversation transcripts with timestamps
- Monitor all MCP tool calls and responses in real-time
- Record timing data for performance analysis
- Detect and log errors, timeouts, and failures
- Structure captured data for efficient analysis and storage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Captures complete conversation flow from test initiation to completion
- [ ] Records all MCP tool calls with parameters and responses
- [ ] Logs timing data for each interaction and overall test duration
- [ ] Detects and categorizes errors (tool failures, timeouts, invalid responses)
- [ ] Stores conversation data in structured format (JSON/database)
- [ ] Provides real-time monitoring capabilities during active tests
- [ ] Includes conversation metadata (test ID, scenario, participant info)
- [ ] Implements data retention and cleanup policies
- [ ] Handles concurrent test sessions without data corruption

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design conversation data schema and storage format
- [ ] Implement MCP tool call monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create conversation transcript capture mechanism
- [ ] Add timing and performance metric collection
- [ ] Build error detection and categorization system
- [ ] Implement real-time conversation monitoring
- [ ] Create data persistence layer (D1/SQLite integration)
- [ ] Add conversation retrieval and query capabilities
- [ ] Implement concurrent session handling
- [ ] Build data export and backup functionality
- [ ] Test capture accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Document capture format and retrieval APIs
