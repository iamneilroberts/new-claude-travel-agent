# S01_M03 Sprint Meta: Research and Architecture Design

## Sprint Overview

**Milestone**: M03 - Prompt Instructions MCP Enhancement
**Sprint Goal**: Research and design the architecture for adding chain execution and template variables to the existing prompt-instructions-mcp server

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete analysis of current prompt-instructions-mcp architecture
- [ ] Design database schema for chains and templates
- [ ] Create technical specification for template engine
- [ ] Design chain execution engine architecture
- [ ] Define new MCP tool interfaces
- [ ] Create implementation roadmap with risk assessment

## Sprint Tasks

### T01: Architecture Analysis and Integration Planning
- Analyze current prompt-instructions-mcp server structure
- Identify integration points for new features
- Document McpAgent framework requirements
- Plan backward compatibility strategy

### T02: Database Schema Design
- Design tables for execution_chains, template_definitions
- Plan migration strategy for existing instruction_sets
- Create relationship diagrams and constraints
- Validate schema against use cases

### T03: Template Engine Technical Specification
- Design variable substitution system with {placeholder} syntax
- Plan validation and schema enforcement
- Design caching and performance optimization
- Create security requirements for input sanitization

### T04: Chain Execution Engine Design
- Design multi-step workflow execution system
- Plan context passing between steps
- Design error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Plan execution tracking and state management

### T05: MCP Tool Interface Design
- Define 4 new tools: execute_chain, process_template, create_chain, create_template
- Design parameter schemas and return formats
- Plan integration with existing 5 tools
- Create usage examples and documentation

## Dependencies

- Existing prompt-instructions-mcp server (working)
- D1 database access (available)
- McpAgent framework (proven working)
- Current instruction_sets table structure

## Deliverables

- Technical architecture document
- Database schema with migration plan
- Tool interface specifications
- Implementation roadmap for S02 and S03

## Sprint Review

**Expected Outcome**: Complete technical foundation for implementation phase, with clear roadmap and validated design decisions.

## Notes

This sprint focuses entirely on research and design to ensure solid foundation before implementation. All design decisions should consider travel agent workflow requirements and maintain the server's travel-specific focus.
