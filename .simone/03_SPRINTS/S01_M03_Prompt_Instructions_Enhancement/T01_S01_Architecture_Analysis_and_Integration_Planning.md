# T01_S01: Architecture Analysis and Integration Planning

## Task Overview

Analyze the current prompt-instructions-mcp server architecture and plan integration points for chain execution and template variables features.

## Objectives

- **Primary**: Document current server architecture and identify safe integration points
- **Secondary**: Plan backward compatibility strategy to ensure zero breaking changes
- **Tertiary**: Validate McpAgent framework requirements for new features

## Scope

### In Scope
- Current prompt-instructions-mcp server code analysis
- McpAgent framework integration patterns
- Existing tool interfaces and database interactions
- Backward compatibility planning
- Integration point identification

### Out of Scope
- Actual implementation of new features
- Database schema changes
- Performance optimization (covered in later sprints)

## Technical Analysis

### Current Server Structure
- **Framework**: McpAgent with SSE transport
- **Tools**: 5 existing tools for travel instruction management
- **Database**: D1 with instruction_sets table
- **Features**: Mode detection, instruction retrieval, session management

### Integration Points to Analyze
1. **Database Layer**: How to extend without breaking existing queries
2. **Tool Layer**: How to add 4 new tools while maintaining current 5
3. **Business Logic**: Where to inject chain and template processing
4. **Error Handling**: How to maintain current error patterns

### McpAgent Framework Requirements
- Verify framework supports additional tool registration
- Confirm schema handling for complex new tool parameters
- Validate SSE transport capacity for larger payloads
- Check environment variable access patterns

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete code analysis of current server (src/index.ts)
- [ ] Document all existing database interactions
- [ ] Identify 3-5 safe integration points for new features
- [ ] Create backward compatibility checklist
- [ ] Validate McpAgent framework capabilities for planned features
- [ ] Document any risks or constraints discovered

## Deliverables

1. **Architecture Analysis Document**
   - Current server component diagram
   - Database interaction patterns
   - Tool registration and execution flow
   - Error handling mechanisms

2. **Integration Plan**
   - Identified integration points
   - Backward compatibility strategy
   - Risk assessment with mitigation plans
   - Framework validation results

## Implementation Notes

### Files to Analyze
- `/remote-mcp-servers/prompt-instructions-mcp/src/index.ts` - Main server code
- `/remote-mcp-servers/prompt-instructions-mcp/package.json` - Dependencies
- `/remote-mcp-servers/prompt-instructions-mcp/tsconfig.json` - Build config

### Key Analysis Points
1. **Tool Registration Pattern**: How tools are currently added to server
2. **Database Access Pattern**: How env.DB is used throughout
3. **Error Handling Pattern**: How errors are caught and returned
4. **Schema Validation**: How Zod schemas are used for tool parameters
5. **Response Format**: How tool results are structured

### Integration Considerations
- New features must not affect existing tool behavior
- Database changes must be non-breaking (additive only)
- New tool names must not conflict with existing ones
- Error handling must follow established patterns

## Next Tasks

This task feeds into:
- T02: Database Schema Design (requires understanding of current DB patterns)
- T03: Template Engine Technical Specification (requires tool integration patterns)
- T04: Chain Execution Engine Design (requires server lifecycle understanding)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Architecture analysis document completed and reviewed
- [ ] All integration points identified and validated
- [ ] Backward compatibility strategy documented
- [ ] No blocking issues identified for planned features
- [ ] Analysis results inform subsequent sprint tasks
