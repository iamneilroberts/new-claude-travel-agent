# Sprint S05: MCP Remote Solution Evaluation

## Sprint Overview
**Goal**: Evaluate alternative MCP remote proxy solutions to replace current mcp-remote implementation experiencing systematic DNS failures

**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Priority**: High - Current MCP infrastructure is unreliable

## Problem Statement
Current mcp-remote (geelen/mcp-remote) experiencing systematic issues:
- EAI_AGAIN DNS resolution failures for specific servers
- Claude Desktop specific failures (CLI works fine)
- Intermittent connection timeouts
- Authentication propagation issues

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete technical analysis of both alternative solutions
- [ ] Performance and reliability testing comparison
- [ ] Architecture compatibility assessment
- [ ] Implementation effort estimation
- [ ] Clear recommendation with rationale

## Alternative Solutions to Evaluate

### 1. open-webui/mcpo
- **URL**: https://github.com/open-webui/mcpo
- **Description**: MCP Orchestrator - part of Open WebUI ecosystem
- **Key Features**: TBD (requires analysis)

### 2. metatool-ai/metatool-app  
- **URL**: https://github.com/metatool-ai/metatool-app
- **Description**: MCP integration platform
- **Key Features**: TBD (requires analysis)

## Current System Requirements
- Support for 9+ concurrent MCP servers
- SSE transport compatibility (Cloudflare Workers)
- Authentication token support
- Claude Desktop integration
- Timeout configuration (30s)
- Network reliability (no DNS failures)

## Sprint Tasks
1. **T01**: Document current mcp-remote issues and requirements
2. **T02**: Analyze open-webui/mcpo architecture and capabilities
3. **T03**: Analyze metatool-ai/metatool-app architecture and capabilities
4. **T04**: Performance testing and reliability assessment
5. **T05**: Implementation planning and effort estimation
6. **T06**: Final recommendation and migration plan

## Dependencies
- Access to current MCP server configurations
- Ability to test with existing Cloudflare Workers
- Claude Desktop testing environment

## Risks
- Alternative solutions may not support our current architecture
- Migration effort may be significant
- Performance degradation during transition
- Compatibility issues with existing MCP servers

## Success Metrics
- Reduced DNS resolution failures (target: 0%)
- Improved connection reliability (target: 99%+)
- Faster MCP server startup times
- Better error handling and diagnostics
