## Risk Assessment Matrix

### HIGH IMPACT, MEDIUM PROBABILITY (Priority 1 - Critical Focus)

**R1: Tool Functionality Regression**
- **Impact**: HIGH - Breaks core D1 database functionality for users
- **Probability**: MEDIUM - Complex tool handler conversion process
- **Description**: One or more of the 8 D1 tools fails to work correctly after migration
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Comprehensive side-by-side testing against McpAgent baseline
  - Tool-by-tool migration with validation at each step
  - Preserve exact business logic and response formats
  - Automated regression testing suite
- **Early Warning**: Tool execution errors, incorrect responses, timeout failures
- **Contingency**: Immediate rollback to McpAgent backup branch

**R2: SSE Connection Instability**
- **Impact**: HIGH - Prevents Claude Desktop from connecting to MCP server
- **Probability**: MEDIUM - Manual SSE implementation vs proven McpAgent.serveSSE()
- **Description**: SSE endpoint fails to maintain stable connections or handle MCP protocol correctly
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement proven SSE patterns from Cloudflare examples
  - Extensive connection testing with curl and Claude Desktop
  - Proper error handling and connection lifecycle management
