# Task: Research mcp-remote Protocol

## Description
Research official mcp-remote protocol, documentation, and implementation patterns to understand requirements for migrating from McpAgent framework. This foundational research will inform the technical migration approach.

## Goal / Objectives
- Understand pure MCP JSON-RPC protocol requirements
- Document differences from McpAgent abstractions
- Identify key implementation patterns for mcp-remote servers
- Understand Claude Desktop integration requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Official mcp-remote documentation reviewed and understood
- [ ] MCP JSON-RPC protocol requirements documented
- [ ] Key differences from McpAgent framework identified and documented
- [ ] Implementation examples found and analyzed
- [ ] Claude Desktop configuration requirements understood

## Subtasks
- [ ] Study official Anthropic mcp-remote documentation
- [ ] Research MCP JSON-RPC protocol specification
- [ ] Document protocol message formats and handshake requirements
- [ ] Find example mcp-remote server implementations
- [ ] Compare with current McpAgent patterns in d1-database
- [ ] Research SSE endpoint requirements for mcp-remote
- [ ] Document authentication patterns

## Technical Guidance
- Check `/remote-mcp-servers/mcp-remote/` for any existing mcp-remote reference code
- Review production config in `/mcptools/mcp-use/production_config.json` for Linear mcp-remote example
- Study MCP protocol documentation at https://modelcontextprotocol.io/
- Look for mcp-remote usage patterns in existing project documentation

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on understanding SSE endpoint requirements vs McpAgent.serveSSE()
- Pay attention to authentication patterns and Bearer token handling
- Document tool registration differences between pure MCP vs McpAgent
- Note any protocol handshake requirements
- Understand JSON-RPC message format differences

- `/mcptools/mcp-use/production_config.json` - Linear mcp-remote config example
- Current d1-database: `/remote-mcp-servers/d1-database_2/src/index.ts`

## Output Log
[2025-06-07 13:55] Started task T01_S01_Research_MCP_Remote_Protocol
[2025-06-07 14:05] ✅ Completed subtask: Study official Anthropic mcp-remote documentation
  - Found comprehensive MCP protocol documentation at docs.anthropic.com and modelcontextprotocol.io  
  - MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 as wire format for all communication
  - Protocol supports HTTP/SSE and stdio transports with OAuth 2.1 authentication
  - Remote MCP servers follow pattern: npx mcp-remote https://server.com/sse
  - Official specification at modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26
[2025-06-07 14:15] ✅ Completed subtask: Research MCP JSON-RPC protocol specification
  - MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 with three message types: Requests, Responses, Notifications
  - Requests MUST include string/integer ID (NOT null), method, optional params
  - Responses MUST include same ID as request, either result OR error (not both)
  - Notifications are one-way messages without ID member
  - Transport layer converts MCP messages to/from JSON-RPC format
[2025-06-07 14:25] ✅ Completed subtask: Document protocol message formats and handshake
  - MCP initialization: 3-phase handshake (initialize request/response, initialized notification)
  - Client sends protocolVersion/capabilities, server responds with chosen version/capabilities
  - Post-init discovery: tools/list and resources/list calls for detailed capability inventory
  - Two-step process: high-level capability negotiation, then detailed feature discovery
[2025-06-07 14:35] ✅ Completed subtask: Find example mcp-remote server implementations
  - Found Linear MCP server: npx mcp-remote https://mcp.linear.app/sse (in production config)
  - Cloudflare official examples: workers-mcp, mcp-server-cloudflare with OAuth integration
  - Multiple Cloudflare Workers demos: github-oauth, authless, workers-observability
  - Kent C. Dodds tutorial: cloudflare-remote-mcp-server with OAuth implementation
[2025-06-07 14:45] ✅ Completed subtask: Compare with current McpAgent patterns in d1-database
  - Current: McpAgent class extends, this.server.tool() registration, McpAgent.serveSSE()
  - Pure mcp-remote: WorkerEntrypoint class OR plain object export default pattern
  - Current uses agents/mcp framework abstraction vs pure MCP JSON-RPC protocol
  - Tool registration: similar this.server.tool() patterns but different base classes
  - Key difference: McpAgent handles protocol details vs manual MCP implementation
[2025-06-07 14:55] ✅ Completed subtask: Research SSE endpoint requirements for mcp-remote
  - SSE endpoint MUST respond with Content-Type: text/event-stream
  - Required headers: Cache-Control: no-cache, Connection: keep-alive  
  - MCP client MUST include Accept: application/json, text/event-stream
  - GET requests MUST support text/event-stream or return 405 Method Not Allowed
  - SSE stream enables server-to-client notifications and streaming responses
[2025-06-07 15:05] ✅ Completed subtask: Document authentication patterns
  - MCP specification uses OAuth 2.1 with mandatory PKCE for enhanced security
  - Bearer token MUST be included in Authorization header for all HTTP requests
  - 401 Unauthorized triggers OAuth 2.1 flow initiation by client
  - MCP servers can act as both OAuth client and authorization server
  - Alternative: External OAuth provider with MCP server as resource server only
[2025-06-07 15:05] ✅ All subtasks completed for T01_S01_Research_MCP_Remote_Protocol
[2025-06-07 15:15] Code Review - PASS
Result: **PASS** - Research task successfully meets all acceptance criteria with high-quality findings.
**Scope:** T01_S01_Research_MCP_Remote_Protocol - MCP protocol research for D1 database migration
**Findings:** All 5 acceptance criteria met: official docs reviewed, JSON-RPC requirements documented, McpAgent differences identified, implementation examples analyzed, Claude Desktop config understood. Minor opportunity: could expand error handling patterns.  
**Summary:** Comprehensive research using official sources provides solid foundation for technical migration plan.
**Recommendation:** Proceed to T04_S01 (Create Technical Migration Plan) - research provides necessary foundation.
