# Sprint: Research and Planning - D1 MCP-Remote Migration (S01)

## Sprint Goal
Research mcp-remote protocol requirements and analyze current d1-database implementation to create implementation plan

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Research official mcp-remote protocol and implementation patterns
- Analyze current d1-database McpAgent implementation (8 tools)
- Study successful mcp-remote implementations for reference
- Create detailed technical migration plan
- Document protocol differences and requirements
- Identify potential implementation challenges

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Complete understanding of mcp-remote protocol requirements
- Current d1-database implementation fully analyzed and documented
- Technical migration plan created with specific implementation steps
- Reference examples identified and studied
- Risk assessment completed with mitigation strategies
- Ready to begin Sprint 2 (Pure MCP Implementation)

## Sprint Tasks
1. **T01_S01** - Research mcp-remote Protocol (Medium)
   - Study official protocol documentation and implementation patterns
2. **T02_S01** - Analyze Current D1 Implementation (Medium)  
   - Document all 8 D1 tools and McpAgent framework patterns
3. **T03_S01** - Study Reference Implementations (Medium)
   - Find and analyze successful mcp-remote server examples
4. **T04_S01** - Create Technical Migration Plan (Medium)
   - Design step-by-step migration approach from analysis findings
5. **T05_S01** - Risk Assessment and Mitigation (Low)
   - Identify risks and develop contingency plans

## Task Dependencies
- T04_S01 depends on: T01_S01, T02_S01, T03_S01
- T05_S01 benefits from all other task findings
- T01_S01, T02_S01, T03_S01 can run in parallel

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Focus on understanding the pure MCP JSON-RPC protocol vs McpAgent abstractions
- Pay attention to Claude Desktop configuration differences
- Document all 8 D1 tools to ensure no functionality is lost during migration
