# Task T01_S05: Baseline Server Status Assessment

## Task Overview
**Sprint**: S05 - MCP Server Audit and Tool Enablement  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Status**: Planned  

## Objective
Establish current status baseline for all MCP servers configured in Claude Desktop, identifying which servers and tools are enabled/disabled.

## Scope
- Audit all servers in current claude_desktop_config.json
- Test server connectivity and tool availability
- Document current configuration state
- Identify immediate issues requiring attention

## Task Steps

### Phase 1: Configuration Review (30 min)
1. Read current claude_desktop_config.json
2. List all configured MCP servers
3. Verify server executable paths exist
4. Check environment variable dependencies

### Phase 2: Server Status Testing (90 min)
1. Test each server individually via Claude Desktop
2. Check tool enablement status for each server
3. Verify server responses and error conditions
4. Document any disabled tools or connection failures

### Phase 3: Documentation (60 min)
1. Create server status matrix spreadsheet/table
2. Categorize issues by type (config, connectivity, tool-specific)
3. Prioritize servers by criticality to travel agent functionality
4. Document baseline for comparison after fixes

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Server Status Matrix** - Complete current state documentation
2. **Issue Categories** - Organized list of problem types
3. **Priority Rankings** - Critical vs. non-critical server issues
4. **Configuration Snapshot** - Current claude_desktop_config.json state

## Tools Required
- Claude Desktop for testing
- File system access for config verification
- Basic memory for storing results

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All servers tested and status documented
- [ ] Issues categorized by type and severity
- [ ] Baseline established for measuring improvements
- [ ] Priority servers identified for immediate attention

## Dependencies
- Access to Claude Desktop environment
- Current claude_desktop_config.json file
- MCP server executables and dependencies

## Notes
- Focus on systematic testing over immediate fixes
- Document exact error messages and behaviors
- Test with fresh Claude Desktop restart between servers
- Save all findings to basic-memory for future reference
