# Sprint S05: MCP Server Audit and Tool Enablement

## Sprint Overview
**Milestone**: M01 - Production System Stability  
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Active  

## Problem Statement
Multiple MCP servers show tools as "disabled" in Claude Desktop, preventing full functionality despite proper configuration. This affects production travel agent capabilities and user experience.

## Sprint Goals
1. **Comprehensive Server Audit**: Systematically test all configured MCP servers
2. **Tool Status Assessment**: Identify which tools are disabled and why
3. **Configuration Validation**: Verify claude_desktop_config.json accuracy
4. **Issue Resolution**: Fix identified problems and restore full functionality
5. **Monitoring Setup**: Establish ongoing health checks for MCP servers

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All production MCP servers report "enabled" status in Claude Desktop
- [ ] All critical tools (search, database, storage) function correctly
- [ ] Configuration files validated and optimized
- [ ] Documented troubleshooting procedures for future issues
- [ ] Automated health monitoring system operational

## Key Deliverables
1. **Server Status Matrix** - Complete audit results for all servers
2. **Configuration Fixes** - Updated claude_desktop_config.json
3. **Troubleshooting Guide** - Step-by-step issue resolution procedures
4. **Health Monitoring** - Automated checks for ongoing server status
5. **Best Practices** - Prevention strategies for future issues

## Servers in Scope
### Production Travel Servers
- amadeus-api-mcp (flights, hotels, POI)
- google-places-api-mcp (places, photos, reviews)
- d1-database-mcp (client data, activity logging)
- r2-storage-mcp (image gallery, file storage)
- template-document-mcp (travel documents)

### Communication & Integration
- mobile-interaction-mcp (WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS)
- prompt-instructions-mcp (dynamic instructions)
- sequential-thinking-mcp (reasoning chains)

### Additional Servers
- Cloudflare MCP (KV, R2, D1, Workers)
- Browserbase MCP (browser automation)
- MCP Omnisearch (Tavily, Brave, Kagi)
- Basic Memory MCP (knowledge storage)

## Risk Assessment
- **High Impact**: Travel agent functionality depends on these servers
- **Time Sensitive**: Production system affecting user experience
- **Complexity**: Multiple servers with different deployment patterns
- **Dependencies**: Some servers may affect others

## Sprint Tasks
Tasks will be created as individual T[XX]_S05_[TaskName].md files.

## Previous Context
- Previous sprints (S01-S04) successfully implemented pure MCP protocols
- Some servers migrated from hybrid implementations
- Configuration management improved but issues persist

## Notes
- Focus on systematic approach over quick fixes
- Document all findings for future reference
- Test both Claude Desktop and Claude Code environments
- Prioritize production-critical servers first
