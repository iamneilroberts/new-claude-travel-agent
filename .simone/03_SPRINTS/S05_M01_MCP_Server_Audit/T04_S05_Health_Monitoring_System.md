# Task T04_S05: Health Monitoring and Prevention System

## Task Overview
**Sprint**: S05 - MCP Server Audit and Tool Enablement  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Status**: Planned  
**Depends On**: T03_S05  

## Objective
Implement automated health monitoring for MCP servers to detect and prevent future tool disabling issues before they impact production.

## Scope
- Create health check utilities for MCP servers
- Implement monitoring for tool availability
- Set up alerting for server failures
- Document troubleshooting procedures

## Task Steps

### Phase 1: Health Check Development (90 min)
1. Create MCP server health check script
2. Implement tool availability testing
3. Add configuration validation checks
4. Build status reporting dashboard

### Phase 2: Monitoring Integration (60 min)
1. Integrate with existing mcp-watcher-service
2. Set up periodic health checks
3. Configure alerting thresholds
4. Create health status logs

### Phase 3: Documentation (60 min)
1. Create troubleshooting runbook
2. Document common issues and solutions
3. Write health monitoring setup guide
4. Create maintenance procedures

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation (30 min)
1. Test health monitoring with simulated failures
2. Verify alerting works correctly
3. Validate troubleshooting procedures
4. Document monitoring effectiveness

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Health Check Script** - Automated MCP server testing
2. **Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time server status display
3. **Troubleshooting Runbook** - Step-by-step issue resolution
4. **Maintenance Procedures** - Preventive care guidelines

## Health Check Components
### Server Level Checks:
- [ ] Server process startup success
- [ ] MCP protocol handshake completion
- [ ] Environment variable resolution
- [ ] API credential validation
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring

### Tool Level Checks:
- [ ] Tool registration with Claude Desktop
- [ ] Tool schema validation
- [ ] Sample tool execution
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Response time tracking

### System Level Checks:
- [ ] Configuration file integrity
- [ ] Dependency availability
- [ ] Resource conflict detection
- [ ] Performance degradation alerts

## Monitoring Features
### Real-time Monitoring:
- Server up/down status
- Tool enablement status
- Error rate tracking
- Performance metrics
- Configuration drift detection

### Alerting:
- Server failure notifications
- Tool disabling alerts
- Performance degradation warnings
- Configuration change alerts

### Reporting:
- Daily health summaries
- Trend analysis
- Issue frequency reports
- Performance baselines

## Tools Required
- Node.js/TypeScript for health check scripts
- Integration with mcp-watcher-service
- File system monitoring utilities
- Basic logging and alerting infrastructure

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Health monitoring system operational
- [ ] All MCP servers monitored continuously
- [ ] Alerting works for simulated failures
- [ ] Troubleshooting procedures validated
- [ ] Documentation complete and accessible

## Integration Points
### With Existing Systems:
- mcp-watcher-service for MCP monitoring
- basic-memory for issue tracking
- Claude Desktop configuration monitoring
- Log aggregation and analysis

### With Future Development:
- Integration with development workflows
- Automated remediation capabilities
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Predictive failure detection

## Dependencies
- Successful completion of configuration fixes
- Access to mcp-watcher-service codebase
- Ability to modify monitoring infrastructure
- Documentation storage system (basic-memory)

## Notes
- Focus on prevention rather than just detection
- Keep monitoring lightweight to avoid resource overhead
- Make troubleshooting procedures user-friendly
- Plan for integration with future automation efforts
