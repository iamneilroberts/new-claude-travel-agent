# Task T03_S05: Configuration Optimization and Fixes

## Task Overview
**Sprint**: S05 - MCP Server Audit and Tool Enablement  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Status**: Planned  
**Depends On**: T01_S05, T02_S05  

## Objective
Apply fixes identified during audit phases to restore full MCP server functionality, optimize configurations, and eliminate tool disabling issues.

## Scope
- Fix claude_desktop_config.json configuration issues
- Resolve environment variable and path problems
- Update server startup parameters and dependencies
- Optimize server performance and reliability

## Task Steps

### Phase 1: Configuration Fixes (60 min)
1. Update claude_desktop_config.json based on audit findings
2. Fix executable paths and working directories
3. Correct environment variable references
4. Optimize server startup arguments

### Phase 2: Server-Specific Fixes (90 min)
For each identified issue:
1. Apply server-specific configuration corrections
2. Update environment variables and API credentials
3. Fix tool schema validation issues
4. Resolve dependency conflicts

### Phase 3: Validation Testing (60 min)
1. Restart Claude Desktop with updated configuration
2. Test all previously disabled tools
3. Verify end-to-end travel workflows
4. Confirm no regressions in working servers

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (30 min)
1. Optimize server startup times
2. Reduce resource usage where possible
3. Implement connection pooling/caching if needed
4. Document performance improvements

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Updated claude_desktop_config.json** - Optimized configuration file
2. **Environment Variable Updates** - Corrected .env file entries
3. **Server Configuration Patches** - Individual server fixes
4. **Validation Test Results** - Proof that fixes work
