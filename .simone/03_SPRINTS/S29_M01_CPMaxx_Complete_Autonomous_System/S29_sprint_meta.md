# Sprint S29: CPMaxx Complete Autonomous Search System

## Overview
This sprint completes the implementation of S28's individual search tools and then adds autonomous operation capabilities to create a fully self-directed CPMaxx search system that requires no Claude intervention during execution.

## Sprint Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: Sprint S28 (Unified CPMaxx MCP Server - Search Tool Automation)
- **Builds on**: mcp-cpmaxx-unified server infrastructure
- **Requires**: mcp-chrome for browser automation

## Sprint Goals

### Part 1: Complete S28 Implementation
1. Implement all remaining search tools from S28
2. Ensure each tool works independently via MCP
3. Maintain visible browser windows for transparency
4. Extract structured JSON results from each search type

### Part 2: Add Autonomous Features
5. Implement searchId-based result storage and retrieval
6. Add commission analysis across all providers
7. Create real-time status tracking system
8. Build session management for authentication
9. Enable fully autonomous operation without Claude oversight

## Success Criteria
- All S28 tools fully implemented and tested
- Results stored and retrievable by searchId
- Commission analysis provides clear recommendations
- Status updates available during long searches
- System handles authentication autonomously
- No Claude intervention needed during searches
- Full integration with Claude Desktop travel agent mode

## Technical Architecture
- Complete mcp-cpmaxx-unified server with all providers
- Result storage system with searchId indexing
- Commission calculation engine
- Status tracking with progress updates
- Session management for CPMaxx authentication
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

## Deliverables
1. Completed S28 search tools (5 tools)
2. Result storage and retrieval system
3. Commission analysis engine
4. Status tracking system
5. Session management system
6. Integration test suite
7. Documentation for Claude Desktop integration
