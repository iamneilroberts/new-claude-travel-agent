# Project Manifest: MCP Server Optimization and Enhancement

This manifest serves as the central reference point for optimizing and enhancing MCP servers in the travel assistant ecosystem. It tracks current focus and links to key documentation.

## 1. Project Vision & Overview

**Mission:** Optimize, fix, and enhance MCP servers to provide seamless integration with Claude Code and Claude Desktop, enabling full CRUD operations and reliable functionality.

**Current Focus:** Fix and enhance the basic-memory MCP server to enable full Claude Code integration with create, read, update, and search capabilities.

**Target Users:** Claude Code users needing reliable MCP server functionality

This project follows a milestone-based development approach using Simone framework.
