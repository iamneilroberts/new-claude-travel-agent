# M01: D1 Database MCP-Remote Migration

## Executive Summary

Migrate the d1-database MCP server from the current McpAgent framework with mcp-use proxy to the official **mcp-remote** architecture recommended by Anthropic and Cloudflare.

## Background

**Current Architecture:**
- d1-database server uses McpAgent framework
- Connects to Claude Desktop via mcp-use proxy
- Custom SSE implementation with Bearer token auth

**Target Architecture:**
- Pure mcp-remote implementation (officially recommended)
- Direct Claude Desktop connection via `npx mcp-remote`
- Standard MCP protocol without custom frameworks

## Business Value

1. **Official Support**: Use Anthropic/Cloudflare recommended approach
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminate mcp-use proxy layer
3. **Better Reliability**: Official mcp-remote has better error handling
4. **Future-Proof**: Aligned with official MCP ecosystem direction

## Technical Requirements

### Must Have
- [ ] Direct mcp-remote implementation (no McpAgent framework)
- [ ] All 8 existing D1 tools working identically
- [ ] Claude Desktop integration via `npx mcp-remote` 
- [ ] Same D1 database functionality preserved

### Should Have
- [ ] Improved error handling vs current implementation
- [ ] Better connection stability
- [ ] Cleaner configuration

## Success Criteria

- ✅ D1 server connects via `npx mcp-remote https://server.workers.dev/sse`
- ✅ All 8 tools (initialize_travel_schema, store_travel_search, etc.) work
- ✅ No functional regression from current McpAgent version
- ✅ Clean removal of mcp-use dependency for this server

## Out of Scope

- Other MCP servers (focus on d1-database only)
- Changes to D1 database schema
- New functionality beyond migration

## Dependencies

- Understanding mcp-remote protocol requirements
- Cloudflare Workers deployment knowledge
- Claude Desktop configuration

## Timeline

**Phase 1**: Analysis and Planning (1 sprint)
**Phase 2**: Implementation (1 sprint)  
**Phase 3**: Testing and Deployment (1 sprint)

## Risk Assessment

**Medium Risk**: Official mcp-remote may have different requirements than McpAgent
**Mitigation**: Keep current version as backup until migration proven successful
