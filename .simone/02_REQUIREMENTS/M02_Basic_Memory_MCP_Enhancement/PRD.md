# M02: Basic-Memory MCP Enhancement - Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement

The basic-memory MCP server is currently not functioning properly with Claude Code, preventing seamless knowledge management and note operations. Additionally, the current design restricts note creation to CLI-only operations, limiting the integration possibilities with Claude Code.

## Current Issues

1. **MCP Connectivity**: basic-memory MCP tools are not accessible in Claude Code
2. **Limited Operations**: Only read/search operations available via MCP  
3. **CLI Dependency**: Note creation restricted to command-line interface
4. **Poor Integration**: Claude Code cannot perform full CRUD operations

## Solution Overview

Enhance the basic-memory MCP server to provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality via MCP tools, enabling seamless integration with Claude Code for knowledge management operations.

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
- ✅ Claude Code can access all basic-memory MCP tools
- ✅ Full CRUD operations available via MCP interface
- ✅ Note creation/writing enabled through MCP tools
- ✅ Search and read operations working reliably
- ✅ Update and delete operations functional

### Secondary Goals  
- ✅ Performance optimization for MCP operations
- ✅ Error handling and validation improvements
- ✅ Documentation and usage examples
- ✅ Integration testing with Claude Code

## Technical Requirements

### MCP Tools to Implement/Fix
1. **mcp__basic-memory__write_note** - Create new notes
2. **mcp__basic-memory__update_note** - Update existing notes  
3. **mcp__basic-memory__delete_note** - Delete notes
4. **mcp__basic-memory__search_notes** - Search existing notes (fix if broken)
5. **mcp__basic-memory__read_note** - Read specific notes (fix if broken)
6. **mcp__basic-memory__list_notes** - List all notes with filtering

### Architectural Changes
- Remove CLI-only restriction for note writing
- Ensure MCP server is properly configured in Claude Code
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Add authentication and security measures as needed

### Integration Requirements
- MCP server must be discoverable by Claude Code
- All tools must have proper JSON schemas
- Response formats must be consistent
- Error messages must be helpful and actionable

## User Stories

### As a Claude Code user, I want to:
1. Create new notes directly through MCP tools
2. Search existing notes seamlessly 
3. Read specific notes by ID or title
4. Update note content and metadata
5. Delete notes when no longer needed
6. List and browse available notes

### As a developer, I want to:
1. Use basic-memory as a reliable knowledge store
2. Integrate note operations into workflows
3. Have consistent API responses
4. Get helpful error messages for debugging

## Acceptance Criteria

### Sprint S01 - Diagnosis and Planning
- [ ] Current MCP connectivity issues identified
- [ ] Root cause analysis completed
- [ ] Technical implementation plan created
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation strategy documented

### Sprint S02 - Implementation and CRUD Operations  
- [ ] MCP server connectivity restored
- [ ] write_note operation implemented and tested
- [ ] update_note operation implemented and tested
- [ ] delete_note operation implemented and tested
- [ ] All operations working through Claude Code

### Sprint S03 - Testing and Validation
- [ ] End-to-end testing completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Error handling validated
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: MCP protocol compatibility issues
- **Mitigation**: Use proven patterns from successful D1 MCP migration

- **Risk**: Authentication and security concerns  
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper validation and access controls

- **Risk**: Performance degradation with large note collections
- **Mitigation**: Implement pagination and optimization strategies

### Project Risks
- **Risk**: Scope creep beyond basic CRUD operations
- **Mitigation**: Focus on core functionality first, enhancements later

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Claude Code MCP integration framework
- Existing basic-memory CLI functionality
- Node.js/TypeScript development environment

### Project Dependencies  
- Completion of D1 MCP migration (provides proven patterns)
- Access to basic-memory codebase and configuration

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- All 6 MCP tools working correctly
- 100% CRUD operation coverage
- Zero critical bugs in core functionality

### Performance Metrics
- MCP tool response time < 2 seconds
- Search operations handle 1000+ notes efficiently
- Memory usage within acceptable limits

### User Experience Metrics
- Seamless Claude Code integration
- Intuitive error messages
- Consistent API responses
