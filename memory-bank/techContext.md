# Technical Context & Infrastructure

## Database Schema Evolution
(Automatically tracked when database files change)

## Current Tech Stack
- **MCP Servers**: 8 working (Amadeus, Google Places, D1, R2 Storage, etc.)
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for images/files
- **Framework**: McpAgent for all MCP implementations
- **Environment**: Cloudflare Workers

## Integration Points
- Amadeus API for flight/hotel search
- Google Places API for location data
- WhatsApp/Telegram for client communication
- CPMAXX for hotel booking integration**Database Schema Update** (2025-06-05 13:04)
- feat: implement D1-powered OAuth MCP server for direct Claude Desktop connections

- Convert PostgreSQL-based OAuth server to use Cloudflare D1 database
- Enable direct Claude Desktop ‚Üí remote MCP server connections via HTTP
- Add OAuth 2.0 authentication with RFC 8252 support (urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob)
- Integrate mcp-remote proxy for OAuth client registration and PKCE flow
- Deploy sequential-thinking MCP server with D1 backend at somotravel.workers.dev
- Eliminate need for mcp-use bridge by using Cloudflare boilerplate pattern

This breakthrough enables Claude Desktop to connect directly to remote Cloudflare
Workers MCP servers, providing a scalable foundation for all future MCP deployments.

**Database Schema Update** (2025-06-09 10:48)
- feat: establish baseline for MCP infrastructure evaluation

## Summary
- Complete Sprint S05 MCP remote evaluation with systematic analysis
- Document current mcp-remote issues and alternative solutions
- Prepare foundation for MetaMCP migration

## Key Changes
- Add comprehensive Sprint S05 documentation in .simone/
- Document DNS resolution issues and 27+ process overhead with mcp-remote
- Create pure MCP implementations for all servers
- Add evaluation infrastructure for mcpo and MetaMCP alternatives
- Update basic-memory knowledge base with troubleshooting insights

## Infrastructure Updates
- All MCP servers now have pure-mcp-index.ts implementations
- Add wrangler.pure-mcp.toml configurations
- Update package.json files for latest MCP SDK compatibility
- Create systematic testing and validation framework

## Documentation
- MCP_TIMEOUT_ANALYSIS_AND_FIX.md: Root cause analysis
- Sprint S05 task documentation with evaluation results
- Basic-memory knowledge entries for future troubleshooting

This commit establishes the baseline before MetaMCP migration testing.

**Database Schema Update** (2025-06-09 18:23)
- feat: restore and enhance D1 database MCP server with comprehensive travel management

Major restoration and enhancement of the d1-database MCP server that was previously
broken due to SSE handler issues. This commit represents significant progress in
rebuilding the core travel management infrastructure.

## Key Achievements

### üöÄ **Core Restoration**
- Fixed broken SSE handler that was causing HTTP 500 errors
- Restored from working backup with airport lookup functionality
- Removed problematic initialize_travel_schema tool causing auth issues
- Successfully deployed and tested - now serving 15 tools

### üõ†Ô∏è **Enhanced Functionality (15 Tools Total)**
- **Core Tools (8)**: travel searches, preferences, SQL queries, schema info
- **Airport/City Lookup**: Essential IATA code conversion (Mobile‚ÜíMOB, Denver‚ÜíDEN)
- **Client Management (3)**: create_client, get_client, search_clients
- **Trip Management (4)**: search_trips, get_trip, get_trip_daily_activities, get_upcoming_trips

### üóÑÔ∏è **Database Integration**
- Leverages comprehensive 46-table travel database schema
- Works with existing Clients (22 records), Trips, TripActivities, Accommodations
- Uses optimized database views (TripSummaryView, TripDailyActivitiesView, etc.)
- Proper column mapping (client_id vs id) for schema compatibility

### üîß **Technical Improvements**
- Fixed SSE endpoint to properly process MCP JSON-RPC requests
- Comprehensive error handling and response formatting
- Proper CORS headers and authentication framework
- Clean backup version management to prevent future confusion

### ‚úÖ **Testing & Validation**
- All 15 tools tested and functional
- Client search: finds 3 Johns, trip search: finds European adventures
- Airport lookup: Mobile,AL ‚Üí MOB (IATA), Denver ‚Üí DEN confirmed working
- Integration ready for Claude Desktop with mcp-remote transport

## Files Changed
- `src/index.ts`: Enhanced with 7 new travel management tools
- `backup_versions/`: Organized previous versions for recovery
- `test-d1-connection.js`: Comprehensive MCP server testing
- `wrangler.pure-mcp.toml`: Updated deployment configuration

## Next Steps
This establishes a solid foundation for:
- Step 3: Moving old versions to backup folder (organizational cleanup)
- Step 4: Integration with Amadeus API and Google Places for complete travel platform
- Claude Desktop integration for full travel agent workflow

üéØ **Mission Critical**: This server is now the backbone of the travel management
system, providing essential client/trip management and airport lookup capabilities
that bridge between user input ("Mobile, Alabama") and API requirements (MOB).

**Database Schema Update** (2025-06-09 19:12)
- feat: complete MCP server migration to standardized mcp-remote pattern

Successfully migrated 10/11 MCP servers (91% completion rate) from custom protocols
to standardized mcp-remote pattern, providing 60+ tools for comprehensive travel
management. Removed experimental MetaMCP infrastructure and established production-ready
deployment with organized backup preservation.

Key accomplishments:
‚Ä¢ Migrated core infrastructure: d1-database, amadeus-api, google-places-api
‚Ä¢ Added value-added services: r2-storage, prompt-instructions, sequential-thinking
‚Ä¢ Integrated communication tools: mobile-interaction, template-document, basic-memory
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive testing: Added test suites validating all server functionality
‚Ä¢ Clean organization: Backup preservation with production-ready structure
‚Ä¢ Live deployment: All servers verified working with Claude Desktop integration

Infrastructure coverage:
‚úÖ Travel database (15 tools) - Client/trip management, airport lookup
‚úÖ Flight/hotel APIs (20+ tools) - Real-time search via Amadeus
‚úÖ Location services (6 tools) - Google Places integration
‚úÖ Image management (6 tools) - R2 storage with photo galleries
‚úÖ Workflow automation (5 tools) - Travel instruction management
‚úÖ Analysis tools (1 tool) - Systematic decision making
‚úÖ Mobile integration (4 tools) - WhatsApp/SMS communication
‚úÖ Document generation (10 tools) - Travel documents and templates
‚úÖ Knowledge management (6 tools) - Basic memory system
‚úÖ Development tools (7 tools) - GitHub integration

**Database Schema Update** (2025-06-09 21:11)
- refactor: split MetaMCP evaluation tools to separate branch

Moved all MetaMCP evaluation files to 'evaluation/metamcp-tools' branch to keep this branch focused on production MCP servers. The enhanced MCP servers using the mcp-remote pattern remain on this branch and are ready for production use.

Split summary:
- MetaMCP evaluation tools ‚Üí evaluation/metamcp-tools branch
- Enhanced MCP servers remain on feature/metamcp-migration branch
- No dependencies between the two - MCP servers work independently

This keeps the repository clean and focused, with evaluation tools available separately if needed.
