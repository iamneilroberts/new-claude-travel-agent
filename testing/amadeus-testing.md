 Current Status ✅

  Worker Deployment: Successfully deployed updated worker-simple.js with correct API endpoints
  - URL: https://amadeus-api-mcp.somotravel.workers.dev
  - Version: bfb94ed3-c03c-4542-9f07-fc0d49093270
  - Auth: Updated with correct API credentials from your .env file

  API Endpoint Fixes Applied:
  - ✅ Flight Search: Updated from /v1/shopping/flight-offers → /v2/shopping/flight-offers
  - ✅ Hotel Search: Updated to use proper two-step process:
    a. Get city IATA code: /reference-data/locations
    b. Get hotel IDs: /reference-data/locations/hotels/by-city
    c. Search offers: /v3/shopping/hotel-offers

  Error Handling: Enhanced to show detailed API subscription errors instead of generic "coming soon" messages

  Resolution Summary
  Issue was with Cloudflare Worker secrets and base URL:
  1. Secrets needed to be set using echo piping: `echo "key" | wrangler secret put`
  2. Base URL fixed from `/v1` to root for proper endpoint construction
  3. Added proper `/v1` and `/v3` prefixes to all endpoints
  4. Production credentials work perfectly for all APIs
  
  Current Status: All APIs fully functional ✅✅✅
