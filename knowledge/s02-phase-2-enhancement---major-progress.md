title: S02 Phase 2 Enhancement - Major Progress
type: project
---

Successfully enhanced both template engine and chain execution engine with advanced features for prompt-instructions-mcp.

## Template Engine Enhancements ✅
**Advanced Template Features:**
- Conditional blocks: {{#if condition}}...{{else}}...{{/if}} 
- Loop blocks: {{#each array as item}}...{{/each}}
- 15+ advanced formatters: date, time, currency, titlecase, truncate, encode, json, reverse, etc.
- Enhanced security: XSS prevention, script detection, complexity analysis
- Comprehensive validation: syntax checking, block matching, security scanning

## Chain Execution Engine Enhancements ✅  
**Enterprise-Grade Workflow Processing:**
- Retry Logic: Exponential backoff, configurable conditions, max attempts
- Rollback Capabilities: Step checkpointing, emergency rollback, rollback operations
- Parallel Execution: Dependency analysis, batch processing, hybrid modes (sequential/parallel/hybrid)
- Advanced Error Handling: Fallback steps, retry/rollback/warn/skip failure modes
- Performance Monitoring: Step timing, memory usage, comprehensive metrics tracking

## Technical Implementation
- Added 8 new interfaces for enhanced capabilities
- 15+ new utility methods for retry, rollback, parallel processing
- Complete TypeScript build success with no errors
- Backward compatibility maintained with existing functionality
- Production-ready error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Next Phase Ready
S02 Phase 3: Full MCP Tools Implementation can now begin with complete specifications and enhanced chain/template integration.

Files Enhanced:
- template-engine.ts: Advanced conditionals, loops, security
- chain-executor.ts: Retry, rollback, parallel, performance monitoring

Sprint: S02_M03_Implementation  
Phase: Enhancement (2/3) - COMPLETED ✅
