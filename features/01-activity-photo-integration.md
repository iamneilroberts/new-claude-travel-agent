## Technical Implementation

### API Integration

- **Data Sources**: MyLittleAdventure aggregation (Viator, GetYourGuide, Klook, Musement)
- **Photo Format**: Direct HTTPS URLs, typically JPEG format
- **Photo Sizing**: Parameterized URLs (e.g., `?w=500` for width)

### Photo Data Structure
```json
{
  "id": "23642",
  "name": "Skip-the-line tickets to the Prado Museum",
  "shortDescription": "Book your tickets for the Prado Museum...",
  "pictures": [
    "https://images.musement.com/cover/0001/07/prado-museum-tickets_header-6456.jpeg?w=500"
  ],
  "rating": "4.500000",
  "price": { "currencyCode": "EUR", "amount": "16.00" },
  "bookingLink": "https://b2c.mla.cloud/c/QCejqyor?c=2WxbgL36",
  "geoCode": { "latitude": 40.414000, "longitude": -3.691000 }
}
```

### Integration Points

#### 1. Destination Search Enhancement
```javascript
async function enhanceDestinationWithPhotos(cityCoordinates) {
  // Use existing search_activities_by_coordinates tool
  const activities = await searchActivitiesByCoordinates({
    latitude: cityCoordinates.lat,
    longitude: cityCoordinates.lng,
    radius: 10
  });
  
  return activities.filter(activity => 
    activity.pictures && activity.pictures.length > 0
  );
}
```

#### 2. Hotel Search Enhancement
```javascript
async function getHotelWithNearbyActivities(hotelLocation) {
  // Search hotels (existing functionality)
  const hotels = await searchHotels(params);
  
  // For each hotel, get nearby activities with photos
  for (let hotel of hotels) {
    hotel.nearbyActivities = await searchActivitiesByCoordinates({
      latitude: hotel.geoCode.latitude,
      longitude: hotel.geoCode.longitude,
      radius: 5
    });
  }
  
  return hotels;
}
```

#### 3. Photo Optimization
```javascript
function optimizeActivityPhoto(photoUrl, targetWidth = 400) {
  // Most activity photos support URL parameters for sizing
  if (photoUrl.includes('musement.com') || photoUrl.includes('viator.com')) {
    return `${photoUrl}?w=${targetWidth}`;
  }
  return photoUrl;
}
```

## UI/UX Requirements

### Photo Display Standards
- **Thumbnail Size**: 300x200px for activity cards
- **Hero Size**: 800x400px for activity details
- **Aspect Ratio**: 3:2 maintained with crop if needed
- **Loading**: Lazy loading with placeholder images
- **Fallback**: Default activity-type images if photo unavailable

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile**: Single column, large thumbnails
- **Tablet**: 2-column grid layout  
- **Desktop**: 3-4 column grid with hover effects

### Performance Optimization
- **Image CDN**: Use photo URL parameters for optimal sizing
- **Preloading**: Preload above-the-fold activity photos
- **Caching**: Browser cache activity photos for repeat visits
- **Compression**: WebP format when supported

## Risk Mitigation

### Photo Availability
- **Risk**: Some activities may not have photos
- **Mitigation**: Fallback to category-specific stock photos, show photo availability rate in admin dashboard

### Loading Performance
- **Risk**: Large photo files affecting page speed
- **Mitigation**: Implement progressive loading, WebP format, CDN optimization

### Third-party Dependencies
- **Risk**: Photo URLs from external providers may break
- **Mitigation**: Photo URL validation, automatic retry mechanisms, backup photo sources

### Mobile Data Usage
