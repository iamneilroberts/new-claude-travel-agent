# Travel Assistant Initialization Setup

## Current Issue

The `/t` command is calling `initialize_travel_assistant` from the prompt-server, but it's returning a pricing system prompt instead of the full travel assistant initialization.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Check Available Prompts
First, check what travel-related prompts are available in the D1 database:
```
/travel check
```
or
```
/prompts category travel
```

### Option 2: Use Database Initialization
If the prompt-server isn't returning the expected content, try loading from the database:
```
/travel db
```

### Option 3: Create/Update the Travel System Prompt

1. First, check if a travel system prompt exists:
```
/prompts search travel system
```

2. If not found, create one:
```
/prompts create travel_assistant_system
```

Then update it with the travel assistant content:
```
/prompts update travel_assistant_system content "You are a sophisticated travel planning assistant..."
```

### Option 4: Fix the Prompt Server

The prompt-server's `initialize_travel_assistant` tool might need to be updated to return the correct prompt. This would require:

1. Checking the prompt-server implementation
2. Updating the tool to return the travel assistant system prompt
3. Or configuring it to load the correct prompt from the D1 database

## Recommended Approach

1. **First**, use `/travel check` to see what prompts are available
2. **Then**, check if there's a main travel system prompt in the database
3. **If needed**, create or update the travel system prompt
4. **Finally**, consider updating the slash command to load from the database if the prompt-server continues to return incorrect content

## Alternative Initialization

You can also manually initialize by:
1. Loading the travel system prompt: `/prompts view travel_system_prompt`
2. Setting it as the system prompt for the conversation
3. Loading any additional context or tools needed

## Next Steps

1. Investigate what prompts exist in the D1 database
2. Create or update the main travel assistant prompt if needed
3. Consider creating a more robust initialization that combines multiple prompts
4. Update the prompt-server tool if you have access to it
